# froggydoro
 
***a pomodoro app with a froggy. that's it:)))***

## Description
Froggydoro is an app based on the Pomodoro technique. It not only works on a mobile device, but also on a PC (in a browser or as a standalone app). The frog is the main character of the animations and its existence enlivens the user experience. These animations are several and can be unlocked by the user to overcome different challenges and achieve their goals. Challenges are listed in the 'achievements' section, which is available alongside the calendar. The calendar allows you to see when the different sessions took place (colours on the days indicate the type of session). <br>
The app itself displays a timer and a frog that indicates the current state of activity. If we are on the working part of session, the animated frog is concentrating and doing something. If we are on the resting part, the frog is resting as well. Also, the user can choose to hear different soundtracks during sessions that can help with concentration, dark and light modes of the app, and create different activities with different amounts of sessions and concentration times. 

## Technologies that are used
